A Detailed Breakdown of the Board Game Reef
I. Introduction: A Deep Dive into Reef
Reef is an abstract strategy game designed by Emerson Matsuuchi, intended for two to four players. The game's primary objective is for players to cultivate the most intricate and visually stunning coral reef on their personal player boards. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most victory points by the end of the game, which are awarded for matching specific coral patterns on cards with the three-dimensional structures built on the board. The game's aesthetic appeal and tactile nature are enhanced by the use of distinct, chunky coral pieces that stack to form a growing reef.

The game's rules are deceptively simple, centered on a two-action turn cycle: either take a card or play a card. This simplicity, however, belies a significant depth of strategy. The central challenge and most elegant element of the game’s design is the purposeful disjunction between the two halves of a card. The coral pieces a player acquires from a card are almost never the pieces needed to score the pattern on that same card. This fundamental design choice necessitates forward-thinking and multi-turn planning. A player must carefully select cards not for immediate scoring, but for the potential of their coral pieces to create patterns that can be scored by other cards in their hand in subsequent turns. This strategic requirement elevates the game beyond a mere tactical puzzle, giving it a feel similar to planning several moves ahead in a game like Chess.

II. Comprehensive Game Setup: Preparing the Reef
Setting up a game of Reef involves preparing the central supplies and each player’s individual components. The process is straightforward, but attention to detail is crucial, especially regarding the number of components used for different player counts.

The initial step is to sort all the game's components. The 112 coral pieces are sorted by color into four distinct supplies. The point tokens, which come in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20, are also sorted into separate supplies. The number of coral pieces used depends on the number of players, as detailed in the table below. Any unused coral pieces are returned to the box, a detail which is critical to the game's pacing.

Player Count	Coral Pieces per Color
2 Players	18 pieces
3 Players	24 pieces
4 Players	28 pieces

This varying number of coral pieces is not simply a matter of scaling; it is a core mechanism that dictates the tempo and duration of the game. Since the game ends when a single color of coral runs out, a smaller supply for fewer players ensures the game does not become a drawn-out affair. This design choice maintains a consistent level of urgency throughout the game, regardless of the number of participants, forcing players to be more deliberate about resource management and the impending end of the game.

Each player receives a personal 4x4 player board. One board features a starfish icon, and the player who receives this board will be the first player of the game. Each player is also given three 1-point tokens to form their initial personal point stock. From the main deck of 60 cards, two cards are dealt face down to each player, forming their starting hand.

To establish the initial board state, each player takes one coral piece of each color (four total) and places them on the four center spaces of their board. An optional setup variant for more experienced players allows them to place these four starting pieces on any non-central spaces, including stacking them, which offers a slightly different initial puzzle.

Finally, the central play area is prepared. The shuffled deck of cards is placed face down. Three cards are drawn from the top of the deck and placed face up in a row next to it to form the card display. The top card of the face-down deck also functions as a fourth, special card that players can acquire. With all components in place, the player with the starfish board begins, and play proceeds clockwise.

III. The Turn Cycle: Your Two Choices
The core gameplay of Reef is defined by a simple, two-action turn cycle. On their turn, a player must choose to either take a card from the central market or play a card from their hand. This choice is at the heart of the game's strategy.

Take a Card
A player choosing this action has two options for acquiring a new card to add to their hand. The first option is to take any one of the three face-up cards in the central display for free. If a card in the display has any point tokens on it, the player collects those tokens and adds them to their personal point stock. The display is then immediately replenished by moving a new card from the top of the deck into the empty slot.

The second option is to take the top card of the face-down deck. This action, however, requires a payment of one 1-point token from the player's personal supply. The paid token is then placed on the card with the lowest printed point value in the display, making it a more enticing option for future players. If there is a tie for the lowest value, the player chooses which of the tied cards receives the token. This paid card-taking mechanic introduces a subtle but powerful form of indirect player interaction. A player must weigh the value of the unknown card from the deck against the cost of a point and the consequence of making a specific card in the display more valuable for an opponent.

A hand limit of four cards is in effect at all times. If a player begins their turn with four cards in hand, they are restricted from taking a new card and must instead perform the "play a card" action. This rule prevents players from hoarding cards and forces them to execute their plans, maintaining a fluid pace to the game.

Play a Card
A player choosing this action plays one card from their hand face up into their personal discard pile. This action is a mandatory two-step process, with the steps always performed in the same order. 

**Card Structure**: Each card has two parts. The top tells you what new reef pieces you can collect and then add onto your reef. The bottom shows you the color combination you need in order to score points that round, after you've added the new pieces first. And the highest scores go to the combos that require you to have reef pieces stacked on top of each other.

First, the player must take the two coral pieces shown at the top of the played card from the central supplies and place them on their board. These pieces can be placed on any empty space or stacked on top of existing coral. The only restriction is a strict height limit of four pieces per stack. Once a piece is placed, it cannot be moved or removed for the remainder of the game.

After placing the coral pieces, the player then scores their reef based on the pattern at the bottom of the card they just played. If the pattern is not present on their board, no points are awarded. However, if the pattern is found, the player collects the points shown on the card for each time the pattern appears, multiplying their score if the pattern is present in multiple, non-overlapping instances.

The fixed order of operations—place coral first, then score—is the most fundamental rule for new players to master. It is common for a new player to play a card hoping to score a specific pattern, only to realize that the coral pieces they are forced to place first will accidentally ruin that very pattern. This rule underscores the game’s core strategy: the pieces placed from a card are almost never intended to score the pattern on that same card. Instead, they are meant to set up the scoring for a 

different card in a player's hand on a future turn, rewarding those who plan ahead.

IV. Building and Scoring Your Reef: A Deeper Look
The strategic core of Reef lies in the intricate process of building a three-dimensional reef that satisfies the various scoring patterns on the cards. To score, a player must understand how patterns are recognized and how height and adjacency come into play.

All pattern recognition is based on a top-down view of the reef. This means that for any given space on a player’s board, only the color of the topmost coral piece in a stack is relevant for scoring. The colors of the pieces underneath a stack do not matter. A critical rule is that a single coral piece cannot be used to count toward more than one completion of a pattern on a single turn. If a player has a pattern that appears multiple times on their reef, each instance must be composed of a unique set of non-shared pieces.

Scoring patterns can be categorized by their conditions, as shown in the table below.

Pattern Type	Condition for Scoring	Source
Basic Patterns	No printed numbers. The color and relative position of the top pieces must match the pattern. Height is irrelevant. Patterns include rows, columns, diagonals, squares, and L-shapes.	
Height-Specific Patterns	A printed number in a pattern (e.g., 2 or 3). The top piece must be of the correct color and at that exact height (e.g., a stack of exactly two pieces).	
"Plus" Patterns	A printed number with a + symbol (e.g., 2+). The top piece must be of the correct color and at that height or higher (e.g., a stack of two, three, or four pieces).	
Wild Pieces with Numbers	A wild piece icon (a four-colored shape) with a printed number. Only the height is relevant; the color of the top piece can be any of the four available colors.	
Special Adjacency Patterns	There are eight cards with unique rules. One such pattern scores points for all adjacent pieces of a specific color that are next to the player's single tallest stack of another color. The player may choose which tallest stack to score from in the event of a tie.	
These diverse pattern types require players to build their reefs with both a top-down and three-dimensional perspective. A truly effective strategy involves building a reef that is flexible enough to satisfy multiple types of patterns with the same pieces, such as a piece that contributes to a height-based pattern while also being part of a larger spatial pattern.

V. Gameplay Walkthrough: A Fictional Game in Progress
To illustrate the game's mechanics, let us follow a few turns in a three-player game between Alice, Bob, and Carla.

The game is set up for three players. Alice has the starfish board and is the first player. The central card display shows a 2-point card, a 4-point card, and a 6-point card. The top card of the deck is a 3-point card. All three players have their starting hands of two cards and their four initial coral pieces placed in the center of their respective 4x4 boards.

Alice's Turn 1:
Alice examines the cards in the display and her hand. One of her cards shows a scoring pattern for a cluster of three blue pieces in a straight line, and the top of the card provides one blue and one yellow coral piece. Another player, Bob, has been building his central coral upward with a stack of purple and red. Alice thinks that Bob might be trying to build a tall stack, so she wants to get the blue pieces she needs to score her blue-line card before Bob takes them. She takes the 4-point card from the display for free. This card's coral is a purple and a green piece, and its pattern scores for a three-piece stack of any color.

Board State Change: The 4-point card is removed from the display and added to Alice's hand. A new card is drawn from the deck to replace it. Alice’s hand now has three cards.

Bob's Turn 2:
Bob's turn begins. He has a card in hand that gives him one yellow and one purple coral, and scores for a two-high stack of purple coral. He decides to play this card. He takes one yellow and one purple piece from the central supplies. He places the yellow piece on a blank space next to his starting coral. He then places the purple piece on top of one of his starting pieces, creating a stack of two. He now checks his board for the scoring pattern. He has created one two-piece stack with a purple top, so he scores 3 points and takes a 3-point token from the central supply.

Board State Change: Bob’s board now has an additional yellow piece and a two-piece stack with a purple top. The central coral supplies for yellow and purple have been depleted by one piece each. Bob’s point total is now 3. His played card is moved to his discard pile.

Carla's Turn 3:
Carla looks at the card display, which now has a card with a 2-point value, a 6-point value, and the new card that was just drawn. The top card of the deck is a 5-point card that provides two green pieces and scores for a three-piece row of green coral. Carla sees this as a perfect way to build toward a future score, so she decides to take the top card of the deck. This requires her to pay one 1-point token from her personal point stock. She places this token on the 2-point card in the display, making it a more attractive option for the next player, Alice.

Board State Change: Carla’s hand now contains three cards, but her score decreases by 1. The top card of the deck is replenished. The 2-point card in the display now has a 1-point token on it, offering a bonus to the next player who chooses it. The display is not replenished from the deck since Carla chose to draw from the deck itself.

This sequence of turns demonstrates the core decisions players face: acquiring cards, paying to get ahead, and strategically placing pieces to create future scoring opportunities.

VI. End of the Game and Final Scoring
The game of Reef does not end after a set number of rounds or turns. Instead, it concludes when a specific condition is met, at which point the final scoring phase begins.

The game ends in one of two ways :

A coral supply runs out: This is the most common ending. As soon as a player takes the last available piece of any one of the four coral colors, the end-game is triggered. The current round is then finished, allowing all players to have an equal number of turns.

The card deck runs out: In the rare event that the deck of cards is exhausted, the game ends immediately.

Because the game's end is tied to a finite resource—the coral supplies—a player can tactically trigger the end of the game. A player who has a significant lead in points or a powerful final-scoring hand may choose to take the last piece of a low-supply coral color to end the game on their terms. This adds a layer of strategic depth, as players must constantly monitor not only their own board but also the central supplies and their opponents’ point totals.

After the game-ending condition is met and the final round (if applicable) is completed, a final scoring phase takes place. During this phase, any cards still remaining in a player's hand may be scored. A crucial distinction from in-game scoring, however, is that during final scoring, a player can only score each completed pattern 

once per card, even if the pattern appears multiple times on their reef.

The player with the highest total score from all their collected point tokens wins the game. In the event of a tie, a multi-step tiebreaker system is used to determine a single winner :

The tied player with the most covered spaces on their player board wins.

If the tie persists, the tied player with the most stacks of four coral pieces wins.

If the tie is still not broken, victory is shared.

This detailed tiebreaker system provides players with secondary strategic goals beyond simply accumulating points. In a close game, a player may prioritize building a wider reef to cover more spaces or focusing on building tall stacks, knowing that these factors could be the deciding factors in a tie. This encourages a more holistic approach to reef building that considers multiple paths to victory.

VII. Advanced Strategic Insights: The Mind of a Reef Master
While Reef can be enjoyed as a light and casual game, its true depth emerges when players embrace its core strategic principles. Mastering the game involves moving beyond simple turn-by-turn decisions and adopting a long-term, multi-turn plan.

The single most important strategic element to grasp is the card-coral dichotomy. An advanced player understands that the coral pieces provided by a card are not for scoring that same card, but for building the necessary patterns to score other cards in their hand on a future turn. This requires a player to plan a sequence of card plays, using the coral from one card to build a pattern that another card can score. This foresight is the defining difference between a high-scoring player and one who struggles to make their pieces fit together.

Hand and resource management are also critical. The hand limit of four cards forces players to be selective about which cards they acquire. A player must constantly evaluate whether taking a new card is worth delaying their current plan or if it is better to play a suboptimal card now to free up a hand slot. Similarly, the use of point tokens as currency for drawing from the deck requires a careful cost-benefit analysis. A player must decide if the potential reward of the unknown card outweighs the cost of the point and the risk of placing a bonus token on a card that an opponent might be able to use.

Player interaction in Reef is subtle and indirect, but powerful. The primary method of influencing opponents is through card drafting. By taking a card from the central display that an opponent might need, a player can disrupt their plans. Another form of interaction, as mentioned earlier, is the placement of a point token on a display card, which effectively makes that card more attractive to the next player. A master player will be aware of these subtle levers and use them to their advantage.

Finally, a truly great strategy is to build a reef with overlapping and flexible patterns. A well-placed coral piece can contribute to a horizontal, a vertical, and a height-based pattern simultaneously. This "combo" mindset is the key to maximizing scores and building a resilient reef that can adapt to the new cards that become available throughout the game.

VIII. Conclusion: A Simple Game with Endless Depth
Reef is a prime example of a game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Its elegant design and simple turn structure mask a deep strategic layer built on multi-turn planning, resource management, and subtle player interaction. The game’s appeal lies in its satisfying blend of tactile components, three-dimensional building, and the constant puzzle of optimizing card plays. The quick flow of play and absence of direct conflict make it an excellent choice for a family or "gateway" game, while the strategic depth ensures it remains engaging for experienced players. In the end, 

Reef offers a rewarding experience, balancing the joy of building a beautiful coral reef with the intellectual challenge of its strategic puzzle.
